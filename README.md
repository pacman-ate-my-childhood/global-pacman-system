The pacman you play by running on your street
-----------------------

What is GPS?
-----------------------
GPS is the Global Pacman system, a multiplayer online pacman game that you play on the
streets using a smartphone.
In the game your phone's gps tells us where you are and as you walk (or run!) your character moves in the game.


Making a map
-----------------------
Before you can start, you're going to have to create a map. Go to "create a new game" and choose
"create a new map". The map editor doesn't really work on mobile so you're going to need to go
to your desktop for this bit.

On the Google map, find the streets you want to play in. The arena should be a few blocks so zoom into
steet level. The map is made up of vertices and edges joining them.
Click the Google map to get a marker, then click "add vertex" to add the vertex to your map.
To join the vertices, select two in the muliple select and click "join vertices".

Now you need a pacman home and a ghost home. The ghost home is where the ghosts go to respawn. Remember
to give your map a name and click "create map" to go.


Invite your friends
-----------------------
When the game has started, you will be pacman. Text the url to your friends and they will join
the game as ghosts


Playing
-----------------------
In the game, ghosts can only see things nearby, but pacman can see everything. The shaded circle on the
map is the ghost home. If you are a ghost, you need to run here when pacman eats you!


*ENJOY!*
