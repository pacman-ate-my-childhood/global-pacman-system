<h2>The pacman you play by running on your street</h2>

<h3>What is GPS?</h3>
<p>
	GPS is the Global Pacman system, a multiplayer online pacman game that you play on the
	streets using a smartphone.
	In the game your phone's gps tells us where you are and as you walk (or run!) your character moves in the game.
</p>

<h3>Making a map</h3>
<p>
	Before you can start, you're going to have to create a map. Go to "create a new game" and choose
	"create a new map". The map editor doesn't really work on mobile so you're going to need to go
	to your desktop for this bit.
</p>
<p>
	On the Google map, find the streets you want to play in. The arena should be a few blocks so zoom into
	steet level. The map is made up of vertices and edges joining them.
	Click the Google map to get a marker, then click "add vertex" to add the vertex to your map.
	To join the vertices, select two in the muliple select and click "join vertices".
</p>
<p>
	Now you need a pacman home and a ghost home. The ghost home is where the ghosts go to respawn. Remember
	to give your map a name and click "create map" to go.
</p>

<h3>Invite your friends</h3>
<p>When the game has started, you will be pacman. Text the url to your friends and they will join
the game as ghosts
</p>

<h3>Playing</h3>
<p>
In the game, ghosts can only see things nearby, but pacman can see everything. The shaded circle on the
map is the ghost home. If you are a ghost, you need to run here when pacman eats you!
</p>

<h3>ENJOY!</h3>
